\brief Execute external shell script

\section Description

Executes shell command periodically or at the end of simulation, e.g. to perform analysis using external command line tools. 

Commands are executed via shell, which means that .bashrc or .profile are read.

To customize the environment, one can set (override) environmental variables (e.g. $PATH).

One can run the shell command in a separate thread in which case the command is simply appended with '&' to fork the process.

Use "%" (percentage) to provide global symbols as arguments in the script. For instance the substring "%time" will be replaced with the current time.

Stdout and sdterr are written to the file "external_output.txt" and "external_error.txt"

- \b separate-thread: Execute process as a fork (appends '&').

Stdout and sdterr are written to the file "external_output.txt" and "external_error.txt"

- \b separate-thread: Execute process as a fork (appends '&').
- \b Command: Executable shell command, e.g. "tail -n 1 logger.txt" or "python analysis.py"
- \b Environment: variable/value, e.g. PATH=\usr\local\bin

\section Example
Say hi at the end of simulation
\verbatim
<External time-step="0">
	<Command string="echo 'Hello World'">
</External>
\endverbatim

Periodically execute python script using simulation output folder as cwd
\verbatim
<External time-step="100">
	<Command string="python /home/USER/scripts/analysis.py">
	<Environment variable="PYTHONPATH" value="/usr/lib/python2.7/">
</External>
\endverbatim

Provide the current time as argument to a python script
\verbatim
<External time-step="100">
	<Command string="python /home/USER/scripts/analysis.py --time=%time">
</External>
\endverbatim

Execute script in a separate thread. This is identical to appending the shell fork command '&'.
\verbatim
<External time-step="100" separate-thread="true">
	<Command string="python /home/USER/scripts/analysis.py">
</External>
\endverbatim
